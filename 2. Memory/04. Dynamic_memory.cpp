/*
	Dynamic memory allocation is the process of allocating memory at the runtime of a program.
	This memory is allocated in the heap of the program instead of stack memory.
	It is useful when:
	=> You are not sure about the size of the array you need
	=> Implementing data structures such as linked lists, trees etc
	=> In complex programs that requires efficient memory management
