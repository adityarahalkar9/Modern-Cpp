// Access modifiers are special keywords in C++, that control the visibility of class members
/*
	- public    : Public specifier makes class members (variables and functions) accessible 
	              from anywhere - inside the class, outside the class, or even other files.
	- private   : Private specifier makes class members accessible only inside the class itself 
			      (mainly member methods), and is mainly used to hide data from outside so that we can make 
				  changes internally later without changing the code of its users. By default, all class 
				  members in C++ are private if no specifier is mentioned.
	- protected : The protected specifier makes members accessible inside the class itself and in its 
				  derived (child) classes, but not form outside code. It is mainly used in inheritance, 
				  allowing child classes to reuse or modify data and functions while still keeping 
				  them hidden from the outside world.
