	Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP (Object Oriented Programming). It is the 
	mechanism by which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods)
	of another class. Inheritance means creating new classes based on existing ones. A 
	class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and fields of that class.

	When a class inherits another class, it gets all the accessible members of the parent class, 
	and the child class can also redefine (override) or add new functionality to them.
